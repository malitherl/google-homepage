Hello! 

This is my first attempt at copying the Google Homepage! I learned quite a bit about the importance of divs, the padding and margins of elements, classes, svg image types, inheritance of properties, and value of color contrast in designing a web page. I haven't done many commits before but I plan on doing more in the future.
